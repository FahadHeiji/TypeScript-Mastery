The differences between statically typed and dynamically typed languages.

**Statically Typed Languages** like Rust, C, and C++ have the following characteristics:
- **Static Variable Types**: Once you declare a variable, you cannot change its type. This means if you declare a variable as an integer, you can't later use it as a string or any other type.
- **Compile-Time Type Checking**: The type of a variable is known at compile time. That is, the type checking is performed during the compilation of the program, not at run time.
- **Better Performance at Run-Time**: Because the types are known at compile time, these languages don't need to check types dynamically at run time, which can lead to better performance.
- **Early Error Detection**: Errors related to type mismatch can be detected earlier, i.e., during the compilation phase. This can make it easier to catch and fix errors.

**Dynamically Typed Languages** like PHP, Python, and JavaScript, on the other hand, have these characteristics:
- **Dynamic Variable Types**: In these languages, you can change the type of a variable. For example, you can assign an integer value to a variable, and later, you can assign a string to the same variable.
- **Execution-Time Type Checking**: Type checking is performed at execution time, not at compile time. This means that the types are checked as the code is being run.
- **Error Detection After Execution**: Errors related to type mismatch may not be discovered until the code is executed. This can sometimes make debugging more challenging.

So, the choice between statically typed and dynamically typed languages often depends on the specific needs of the project, the team's familiarity with the language, and the trade-offs between flexibility and safety. Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses, and understanding these can help you choose the right tool for the job.

**Enums** in TypeScript are a special kind of data type that allows us to declare a set of named constants. This can be used for logical grouping of a collection of related values, which helps to organize your code.

In the code, we've shown some advanced uses of Enums:

1. **Enum Can Refer To Other Enum:** An Enum can refer to another Enum for its value. In the code, `Kid` in the `Level` Enum is assigned the value of `Ten` from the `Kids` Enum.

```typescript
enum Kids {
  Five = 25,
  Seven = 20,
  Ten = 15
}

enum Level {
  Kid = Kids.Ten,
  ...
}
```

2. **Enum Can Refer To Same Enum:** An Enum can refer to its own previously declared members. In the code, `Medium` in the `Level` Enum is assigned the value of `Easy` from the same Enum minus 3.

```typescript
enum Level {
  ...
  Easy = 9,
  Medium = Easy - 3,
  ...
}
```

3. **Enum Can Have Calculations:** An Enum member can have a calculated value. As shown above, `Medium` is calculated as `Easy - 3`.

4. **Enum Can Have Functions:** An Enum member can be assigned the return value of a function. In the code, `Hard` in the `Level` Enum is assigned the return value of the `getHardSeconds` function.

```typescript
function getHardSeconds() : number {
  return 3;
}

enum Level {
  ...
  Hard = getHardSeconds()
}
```

In summary, Enums in TypeScript are a powerful feature that allows you to define a set of named constants. They can be used to make your code more readable and organized. The ability to refer to other Enums, perform calculations, and use functions makes them even more flexible and powerful.

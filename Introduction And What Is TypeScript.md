## Introduction to TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing. This means it builds on top of JavaScript's functionality, providing additional features to enhance code quality and maintainability.

**Why TypeScript?**

JavaScript is a powerful language, but its loose typing nature can lead to errors that might go unnoticed until the code is running. TypeScript addresses this by allowing you to define data types for variables, functions, and other code elements.

**Benefits of TypeScript:**

* **Improved IDE Support:** Development environments can leverage type information for better features like code completion and error checking.
* **Early Error Detection:** Type mismatches are caught during compilation (before code execution), saving debugging time.
* **Larger Project Management:** Static typing helps organize code and reduces errors caused by unexpected data types, especially in large projects.

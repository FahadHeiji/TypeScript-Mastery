1. **TypeScript Interface**: An interface in TypeScript is a way to define a contract on a function with respect to the arguments and their type. Along with functions, an interface can also be used with a Class as well to define custom types.

2. **TypeScript Class Interface Implement**: In TypeScript, a class can implement an interface to ensure that it adheres to a certain structure. This means that the class must contain the properties and methods defined in the interface.

3. **TypeScript Class Type Annotations**: Type annotations in TypeScript are a way to explicitly specify the type of a variable, function parameter, function return value, or class property. This can make the code more predictable and easier to understand.

4. **TypeScript Class Inheritance**: In TypeScript, a class can inherit from another class, gaining access to its properties and methods. This is done using the `extends` keyword.

5. **TypeScript Class Extends**: The `extends` keyword is used in class declarations or class expressions to create a class that is a child of another class. The derived class inherits all the properties and methods from the base class.

These concepts are fundamental to understanding and working with TypeScript. They provide a way to create structured, reusable, and type-safe code.

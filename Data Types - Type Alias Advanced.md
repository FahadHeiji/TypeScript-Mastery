In TypeScript, a Type Alias can be used to create complex types by combining existing types. This can be done using the `&` operator, which creates an intersection type.

In your code, you've defined a type alias `Buttons` that represents an object with four properties: `up`, `right`, `down`, and `left`, all of which are strings.

```typescript
type Buttons = {
  up: string,
  right: string,
  down: string,
  left: string
}
```

Then, you've defined another type alias `Last` that represents an intersection of `Buttons` and an object with a single property `x` of type `boolean`.

```typescript
type Last = Buttons & {
  x: boolean
}
```

This means that an object of type `Last` must have all the properties of `Buttons` and also the `x` property.

You've then defined a function `getActions` that takes an argument `btns` of type `Last`. This function logs the values of the `up`, `right`, `down`, and `left` properties of `btns`.

```typescript
function getActions(btns: Last) {
  console.log(`Action For Button Up Is ${btns.up}`);
  console.log(`Action For Button Right Is ${btns.right}`);
  console.log(`Action For Button Down Is ${btns.down}`);
  console.log(`Action For Button Left Is ${btns.left}`);
}
```

Finally, you've called `getActions` with an object that has the properties `up`, `right`, `down`, `left`, and `x`.

```typescript
getActions({ up: "Jump", right: "Go Right", down: "Go Down", left: "Go Left", x: true });
```

In summary, Type Alias in TypeScript is a powerful feature that allows you to create complex types by combining existing types. It can make your code more readable and maintainable by providing descriptive names for complex types.

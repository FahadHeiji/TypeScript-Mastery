In TypeScript, an interface can be reopened to add new properties. This is useful when you want to extend an existing interface with additional properties for different use cases.

Let's take a look at an example:

```typescript
// Homepage
interface Settings {
  readonly theme: boolean;
  font: string;
}

// Articles Page
interface Settings {
  sidebar: boolean;
}

// Contact Page
interface Settings {
  external: boolean;
}
```

In this example, we have a `Settings` interface that is reopened twice. The initial `Settings` interface has a `theme` and `font` property. Then, for the Articles Page, we reopen the `Settings` interface to add a `sidebar` property. Finally, for the Contact Page, we reopen the `Settings` interface again to add an `external` property.

We can then create an object that adheres to this interface:

```typescript
let userSettings: Settings = {
  theme: true,
  font: "Open Sans",
  sidebar: false,
  external: true
}
```

In this `userSettings` object, we have defined the properties as per the `Settings` interface. The `theme` property is set to `true`, the `font` property is set to `"Open Sans"`, the `sidebar` property is set to `false`, and the `external` property is set to `true`.

This is a basic overview of how interface reopening and use cases work in TypeScript. They provide a way to extend interfaces with additional properties, making the code more flexible and adaptable to different scenarios.

**Type Annotations** in TypeScript are used to explicitly specify the type of a variable, function input/output, or object. They are also known as the signature of a variable or function. Here's how they work:

- **Variable Type Annotations**: When you declare a variable, you can specify its type. For example, `let theAge: number = 40;` declares a variable `theAge` of type `number`. If you try to assign a value of a different type to `theAge`, TypeScript will throw an error.

- **Function Type Annotations**: You can specify the types of a function's inputs and output. For example, in the function `function add(n1: number, n2: number)`, `n1` and `n2` are both declared as numbers. TypeScript will enforce that any values passed to `add` are numbers, and it expects `add` to return a number.

- **Object Type Annotations**: You can also specify the types of the properties of an object.

Now, why do we use Type Annotations? They are used to enforce type safety. This means that the TypeScript compiler will check the types of your variables and function outputs, and throw an error if you try to assign a value of the wrong type. This helps catch errors early in the development process.

Is it mandatory to use Type Annotations? No, it's not mandatory. TypeScript has a feature called type inference, which means that if you don't specify a type, TypeScript will try to infer it based on the initial value. For example, if you write `let theName = "Elzero";`, TypeScript infers that `theName` is a string.

What happens if we don't use Type Annotations? If you don't use them, TypeScript will use type inference. But if TypeScript can't infer the type, it will default to the `any` type.

The `any` type in TypeScript is a powerful and flexible type that essentially opts out of type-checking. A variable of type `any` can hold a value of any type, and you can call any methods or access any properties on it, whether they exist or not. For example, `let all: any = "Elzero Web School";` declares a variable `all` of type `any`, and you can assign a value of any type to `all`.

However, while the `any` type is very flexible, it also bypasses a lot of type safety checks, so it should be used sparingly. It's often better to use a specific type if you know what it should be.

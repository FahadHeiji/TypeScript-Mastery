**Polymorphism** is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It means that the same method can have different behaviors in different classes. In TypeScript, polymorphism is achieved through inheritance and method overriding.

In this code, `Player` is a superclass with a method `attack()`. The `Amazon` and `Barbarian` classes are subclasses that extend the `Player` class.

```typescript
class Player {
  constructor(public name: string) {}
  attack() : void {
    console.log("Attacking Now");
  }
}
```

Both `Amazon` and `Barbarian` override the `attack()` method of the `Player` class, providing their own implementations. This is an example of **method overriding**, which is a key aspect of polymorphism.

```typescript
class Amazon extends Player {
  constructor(name: string, public spears: number) {
    super(name);
  }
  override attack(): void {
    console.log("Attacking With Spear");
    this.spears -= 1;
  }
}

class Barbarian extends Player {
  constructor(name: string, public axeDurability: number) {
    super(name);
  }
  override attack(): void {
    console.log("Attacking With Axe");
    this.axeDurability -= 1;
  }
}
```

Finally, an instance of the `Barbarian` class is created and its properties and methods are accessed:

```typescript
let barOne = new Barbarian("Elzero", 100);

console.log(barOne.name);
barOne.attack();
console.log(barOne.axeDurability);
```

This code demonstrates that even though `barOne` is an instance of `Barbarian`, it can be treated as an instance of `Player`. When the `attack()` method is called on `barOne`, the overridden method in the `Barbarian` class is executed, not the one in the `Player` class. This is polymorphism in action.

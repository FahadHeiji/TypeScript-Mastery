1. **TypeScript Generics Interface**: Generics can be used with interfaces in TypeScript to create flexible and reusable code. A generic interface has a generic type parameter list in angle brackets `<>` following the name of the interface⁴¹⁴¹⁵¹⁶.

2. **TypeScript Generics Types**: Generics in TypeScript are like variables that store the type (for example number, string, boolean) as a value. They allow you to write functions that accept arguments of any type and return values of that same type, ensuring consistency and type safety⁴⁵⁶⁷.

3. **TypeScript Optional Generics**: To make a generic type optional, you can assign `void` as the default value. This means that even if you don't pass a specific type when using a generic function or class, TypeScript will use `void` as the default type¹¹¹²¹³.

4. **TypeScript Generics Use Cases**: Generics are commonly used in TypeScript to create reusable components that can work with multiple types. They allow you to define functions, classes, and interfaces that can operate on a variety of data types, while still maintaining type safety⁶⁹¹⁸.

5. **TypeScript Generics and Classes**: Generics can also be used with classes in TypeScript. This allows you to create classes that can work with a variety of types rather than a single one. You can create instances of the class with different types⁴⁸⁹[^10^].

6. **TypeScript Method Override**: Method overriding is a feature in TypeScript that allows a subclass to provide a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. It is used for runtime polymorphism and to implement the concept of inheritance¹²³.

**1. TypeScript Configuration File**
The TypeScript configuration file, `tsconfig.json`, is used to specify the root files and the compiler options required to compile a TypeScript project. It can include options such as `target` (specifies the ECMAScript target version), `module` (specifies the module code generation), `strict` (enables all strict type checking options), and many others.

**2. TypeScript Type Annotations**
Type annotations in TypeScript are a way to explicitly specify the type of a variable, function parameter, function return type, etc. They help with static type checking, making the code more predictable and easier to debug. For example, `let age: number = 30;` specifies that `age` is a number.

**3. Statically Typed Languages**
Statically typed languages are those in which variable types are checked at compile-time. Examples include TypeScript, C, C++, Java, and Rust. In these languages, you must specify the type of a variable when you declare it, and once it's declared, the type can't be changed.

**4. Static Type Checking**
Static type checking is the process of verifying the type safety of a program based on analysis of a program's text (source code). If a program passes static type checking, then it is guaranteed not to cause certain kinds of runtime type errors. TypeScript uses static type checking to catch errors before the code is run.

**5. Programming Type Signature**
In programming, a type signature or type annotation refers to the specification of the type information associated with a function or variable. This can include the types of input parameters, return types, and the types of variables. Type signatures play a crucial role in statically-typed languages, where they are used for type checking.

**6. TypeScript Optional Operator**
In TypeScript, the optional operator (`?`) is used to mark a property as optional. This means that the property may or may not exist in the object, and the compiler won't throw an error if the property is not present. For example, in the type annotation `{name?: string}`, `name` is an optional property and can be either a string or undefined.

In TypeScript, **Type Annotations** with objects are a way to define the shape and the types of the properties of an object. Here's a breakdown of your code:

```typescript
let myObject: {
  readonly username: string,
  id: number,
  hire?: boolean,
  skills: {
    one: string,
    two: string
  }
} = {
  username: "Elzero",
  id: 100,
  hire: true,
  skills: {
    one: "HTML",
    two: "CSS"
  }
};
```
In this snippet, you're defining `myObject` with a specific structure:
- `username` is a read-only `string`. The `readonly` keyword means that once a value is assigned to `username`, it cannot be changed.
- `id` is a `number`.
- `hire` is an optional `boolean`. The `?` means this property may or may not exist on the object.
- `skills` is an object itself with properties `one` and `two`, both of which are `string`.

Then you're assigning an object to `myObject` that conforms to this structure.

```typescript
// myObject.username = "Osama";
myObject.id = 101;
myObject.hire = false;

console.log(myObject.username);
console.log(myObject.id);
console.log(myObject.hire);
console.log(myObject.skills.one);
```
In this part, you're trying to change the `username`, `id`, and `hire` properties of `myObject` and then log them. However, the line changing `username` is commented out because `username` is read-only and cannot be changed after it's set. The other properties are successfully changed and logged.

Remember, TypeScript's type system allows you to build complex and reusable types by combining existing ones. It's a powerful feature that helps to catch errors at compile time, making your code more robust and maintainable.

## TypeScript Mastery 2024

---

### Overview

This repository documents my journey through the "[**Learn TypeScript 2022**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAy532K9M_fjiAmrJ0gkCyLJ)" course. It provides a structured archive of code snippets, detailed notes, and completed assignments for each lesson. 



**Focus on Value:**

* **Learn from my notes:** Gain insights beyond what the videos offer.
* **Practice with assignments:** Solidify your understanding through practical work.
* **Organized for easy access:** Find lesson materials quickly with dedicated branches.

### Repository Structure

**Branches:**

* Each lesson has a corresponding branch named `lesson-<number>-start` (initial setup) and `lesson-<number>-end` (completed work).
* Consider using a consistent naming convention like `L<lesson_number>-start` and `L<lesson_number>-end` for better readability.

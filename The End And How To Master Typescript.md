In TypeScript, **generics** can be used with interfaces to create flexible and reusable code. This allows you to create classes that can work with a variety of types rather than a single one.

In this code, `Book` and `Game` are interfaces that define the structure of a book and a game respectively.

```typescript
interface Book {
  itemType: string;
  title: string;
  isbn: number;
}

interface Game {
  itemType: string;
  title: string;
  style: string;
  price: number;
}
```

`Collection` is a generic class that can work with any type `T`. It has a `data` property which is an array of type `T`, and an `add` method that takes an item of type `T` and adds it to the `data` array.

```typescript
class Collection<T> {
  public data: T[] = [];
  add(item: T) : void {
    this.data.push(item);
  }
}
```

You can create instances of the `Collection` class with different types. For example, `itemOne` is an instance of `Collection` with type `Book`, and `itemTwo` is an instance of `Collection` with type `Game`.

```typescript
let itemOne = new Collection<Book>();
itemOne.add({ itemType: "Book", title: "Atomic Habits", isbn: 150510 });
itemOne.add({ itemType: "Book", title: "Follow Your Heart", isbn: 650650 });
console.log(itemOne);

let itemTwo = new Collection<Game>();
itemTwo.add({ itemType: "Game", title: "Uncharted", style: "Action", price: 150 });
console.log(itemTwo);
```

This is a powerful feature of generics in TypeScript. It allows you to write flexible and reusable code that can handle a variety of different types of data.

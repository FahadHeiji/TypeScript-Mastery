In TypeScript, **generics** can be used with multiple types. This allows you to create functions that can handle multiple different types of data at the same time.

In this code, you have a function `multipleTypes` that takes two arguments of different types and returns a string. The types of the arguments are specified as type variables `<T, S>`.

```typescript
function multipleTypes<T, S>(valueOne: T, valueTwo: S): string {
  return `The First Value Is ${valueOne} And Second Value ${valueTwo}`;
}
```

You can call this function with any types of data, and TypeScript will ensure that the types of the input match the types you specified when you called the function.

```typescript
console.log(multipleTypes<string, number>("Osama", 100));
console.log(multipleTypes<string, boolean>("Elzero", true));
```

This is a powerful feature of generics in TypeScript. It allows you to write flexible and reusable code that can handle a variety of different types of data.

You also have a function `returnTypeArrowSyntax` that is defined using arrow function syntax. This function is equivalent to the `returnType` function, but it's written in a more concise way.

```typescript
const returnTypeArrowSyntax = <T>(val: T): T => val;
```

Finally, the `testType` function takes an argument of any type and returns a string that includes the value and the type of the argument. This function demonstrates how you can use generics to handle any type of data and still maintain type safety.

```typescript
function testType<T>(val: T): string {
  return `The Value Is ${val} And Type Is ${typeof val}`;
}
```
